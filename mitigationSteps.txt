Immediate actions guidance
- Delete node_modules and lockfiles having malicious versions
- Clean npm cache
- do a dry-run to check what packages will be installed (npm i --dry-run --ignore-scripts)
- reinstall only using npm install with --ignore-scripts flag
- pin to known-good versions using package-lock.json
- after pinning good versions in package-lock.json, use (npm ci --ignore-scripts) for further installs
- Audit environments (CI/CD agents, developer laptops) that installed the affected versions for unauthorized publishes or credential theft.
- Rotate npm tokens and other exposed secrets if these packages were present on machines with publishing credentials.
- Turn on multi factor authentication on GitHub and npm.
- Clean infected repositories('shai-hulud' branches and workflows).
- Audit Cloud Infrastructure for Compromise
- Monitor network logs for active exploitation.
- Monitor logs for unusual npm publish or package modification events.
